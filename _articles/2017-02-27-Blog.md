Recently I was researching into real-world application of NLP techinques driven by Buiness decisions and one of the article that enlightened me is below:  
> PUBLIC OPINION ANALYSIS BASED ON PROBABILISTIC TOPIC MODELING AND DEEP LEARNING, by Baojun Ma, el.  

The articles covered a lot of NLP techinuqes, such as LDA on topic modeling, W2V on explict sentiment dictionary building, and time series analysis on agregated emotion.  With all these tools, the article gave us a novel method of public opinion analysis on social media website.  

The idea behind this article is that, given a certain topic，the results of runing LDA will then become different public opinions/aspects of this topic. More importantly, for a centain topic, the public focus may change along with the time. New evidences, new viewpoints may emerge. As a result, the emotional intensity of the public may change continuously. Therefore, **it is of great importance to look into the the evolution of these emotions with temporal change.**  

The working pipeline is below: 

> Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is used firstly to explore the public’s different viewpoints and opinions about a hot event on social platforms. Then, the deep learning model named word2vec is introduced to calculate the vector for each term in the corpus, and then obtain emotional words and their corresponding emotional intensity by calculating their cosine distance; next, by using time series analysis, the change of public’s emotional intensity along with the evolution of the event is tracked.  

Here is a full graph of the working pipeline:

This is a very interesting application of sentiment analysis especially with few adventages:
- The size of this type of topic is fairly small, which means it is suitable to LDA since both SVD and LDA are slow and expensive in computation. One could easily run same analysis on week news to track down the sentiment evolution.
- Even though usually W2V requires massive corpus but it still performs well on this analysis with few reasons such as, the resource is news, which means the language is fairly structured, and the topic is specific therefore we can still have meaningful vector representation of related words.
- It replicates well on other topics, for instance, on measuring the public opinion of political issues, since usually few different news hold different views.   

After all, this is a great method in mining valueable ideas and market emotions if we took the idea and apply it on business related task. I am going to try few projects with this idea.
